1. Install dependencies and packages in requirements.txt
2. 
 - Run the cells in the `SAM2_with_BCNN.ipynb` notebook in order (google colab version)
 - Run the cells in the `SAM2_with_BCNN_Local.ipynb` notebook in order (local version)
    - Note: Ensure CUDA is installed and set up correctly on your local machine if you do decide to run the local version on your local machine.

## Notes

- Due to the large size of the medical dataset, a few were picked to be used in the notebook for a rough draft of how the code works.
- Removed the data .gz file from this folder since it might be too large to upload for the assigment through Canvas (was ~3GB for a single one).
- `create_subdatasets.py` was used to create a smaller dataset for testing purposes
