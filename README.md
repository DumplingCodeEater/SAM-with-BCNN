## Notes

- Due to the large size of the medical dataset, a few were picked to be used in the notebook for a rough draft of how the code will work.
- Removed the data .gz file from this folder since it might be too large to upload for the assigment through Canvas (was ~3GB for a single one).
- `create_subdatasets.py` was used to create a smaller dataset for testing purposes
